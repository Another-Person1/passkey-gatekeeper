# Passkey Gatekeeper
I like passkeys; they're secure and convenient.

What I don't like is sites spamming you with passkey creation requests multiple times in order to get you to create an account.

This extension allows you to prevent certain sites from creating passkeys while allowing you to sign in with existing passkeys.
